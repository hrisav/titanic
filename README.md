# Titanic Data Set

The data has been split into two groups:

training set (titanictrain.csv)
test set (titanictest.csv)

The training set is used to build machine learning models. For the training set, the outcome for each passenger is provided.

The test set is used to see how well the model performs on unseen data. For the test set, outcome for each passenger was predicted and values were stored in a submission file (submission.csv).

Here I have tried applying various algorithms to check which gives best accuracy score, and found out SVM provides an accuracy of 97.37% on test data.
